    convey concepts to both specialist and general audiences. These<br>
    events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio<br>
    while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of<br>
    contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and<br>
    additional resources are available on the Graphics Project Webpage.</p>

<p>Graphics Project Workshops are open to all current GSAPP Students. Both lectures on this date will occur in the same meeting. details on day 2 presentations here.</p>
